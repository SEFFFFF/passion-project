# Passion project

This repository contains a collection of POCs I made for the S3 passion project.

It is an exploration of creative coding using P5js.




## Features

- Webcam pixel grid: Translates webcam pixel info to ellipse size.
- Random dot grid: Makes a grid with random dot sizes and colors.
- Rotating grid: A grid with vectors that flow to point.
- Circle draw: Tool that makes circular patterns.
- Spinning star: Animation of line wrapping around itself and spinning.
- Mouse grid: Grid were shapes angle towards mouse.


## Future

In the next semester I will expand on the POCs made here and look for more ways to make it interactive and complex.
